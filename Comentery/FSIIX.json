        "PerformanceReview": "As the world's largest economies grew steadily and mostly in unison, international stocks performed strongly for the quarter. The fund's share classes performed roughly in line with the 4.25% return of the MSCI EAFE Index.By region, Japan (+8%) fared best, largely due to continued government stimulus \u2013 including equities purchases by the Bank of Japan. Meanwhile, many companies in Asia Pacific ex Japan (+7%) benefited from positive economic reports and increased consumer and commercial demand from China. The U.K. (+5%), meanwhile, slightly outperformed the index amid progress on the country's exit, or \"Brexit,\" from the European Union. Europe ex U.K (+1%) posted the most muted results. Political issues \u2013 most notably in Germany and Spain/Catalonia \u2013 a stronger euro and modest GDP growth all weighed on returns. Numerous countries, including Sweden (-4%), Italy (-3%) and Finland (-3%), fell into negative territory for the three months.Looking closer at the index's 11 sectors, energy (+10%) posted the biggest gains, propelled by higher oil prices. Materials (+8%) also had a strong quarter as the outlook for construction and development continued to improve. Robust consumer spending and as solid third-quarter earnings aided consumer discretionary (5%), information technology (+5%) and consumer staples (+5%). The uptick in global demand, meanwhile, lifted the result for industrials (+5%). Elsewhere, given the strong growth environment, more-defensive areas of the market \u2013 namely, utilities (-1%), health care (0%) and telecommunication services (+1%) \u2013 fell significantly behind the index's quarterly return. Regardless of the market backdrop, we apply a disciplined investment process across all of our strategies, relying on highly skilled professionals and robust investment infrastructure. Investment performance \u2013 absolute, relative and risk-adjusted \u2013 is the foundation of our investment value proposition for shareholders. This is true of our comprehensive suite of low-cost index funds. We expect our index funds to perform as closely as possible to their benchmarks. Over time, we seek to reduce tracking error, also known as the amount an index fund's performance deviates from its target index. Whether it's through solid trading techniques for funds that completely replicate an index or our use of statistical sampling and optimization techniques when necessary, we are focused on delivering returns in line with benchmark performance. \u25a0",
