        "KeyTakeaway": "For the semiannual reporting period ending January 31, 2018, the fund returned -0.85%. This was roughly in line, net of fees, with the -0.59% return of the benchmark Bloomberg Barclays GNMA Index. The result also was roughly in line with the Lipper peer group average.On December 1, 2017, Sean Corcoran became Co-Manager of the fund, replacing William Irving.Sean and Franco Castagliuolo, who has served as Co-Manager of the portfolio since 2009, attempted to exploit market inefficiencies and identify attractively priced securities.The fund's overweighting in high-coupon securities helped its performance versus the benchmark the past six months, as did its underweighting in securities comprised of Veterans Affairs (VA) mortgages.In contrast, an overweighting in Puerto Rico mortgages hurt relative performance.Looking ahead, Franco and Sean believe that returns for GNMA securities are likely to remain paltry over the short term, given low yields and the potential for rising interest rates.",
        "PortfolioManagersPlan": "\"As of January 31, we think concerns among fixed-income market participants that long-term government bond yields could rise significantly due to the Federal Reserve's efforts to shrink its balance sheet seem to have been somewhat overstated \u2013 at least so far.\"In recent months, yields have indeed risen, and worries have persisted that the Fed's slower pace of asset buying could exacerbate this phenomenon. This is somewhat understandable: The mere suggestion of a balance-sheet unwind four years ago sent yields surging in a market reaction many dubbed the 'taper tantrum.'\"As of October 2017, the central bank began the actual the process of shrinking its balance sheet, which grew substantially in the aftermath of the 2007\u20132009 financial crisis, due to Fed asset purchases meant to stimulate the economy.\"Specifically, the Fed is letting some of its Treasury and mortgage-backed bonds expire without replacing them, and plans to further slow the rate of its asset repurchases every three months.\"We'll be closely monitoring further balance-sheet reduction developments, because they could affect bond-market yields.\"",

        "OutlookAndPositioning": "The U.S. economy appears relatively strong and stable, although corporate leverage has increased and credit ratings have generally migrated downward. Meanwhile, the federal government has likely increased its future indebtedness due to the recent tax cuts. In addition, most credit markets appear fully valued, as the yield advantage of these bonds over comparable-maturity Treasuries has declined, making it harder to find attractively valued securities.We are somewhat cautious regarding the impact of the tax cuts. While the changes are likely to have a positive impact on growth and investment in the near term, the medium term is much less certain, as market participants may begin to forecast higher deficits and, thus, an eventual expiration of the cuts down the road. The federal government has gone through several rounds of cutting and raising taxes during the post-WWII period. For example, 10-year sun-setting tax cuts enacted during the Bush administration were subsequently allowed to expire during the Obama administration.The U.S. Federal Reserve still anticipates three quarter-point interest rate increases in 2018, two more the following year, and two in 2020. However, the path for Fed policy remains unclear, given the many uncertainties the central bank faces, particularly the impact of fiscal policy and the degree of inflationary pressure.Overall, the market backdrop creates the potential for periods of increased volatility.Although volatility can be challenging for investors over the short term, we believe it may provide opportunities to position our bond funds for longer-term outperformance.At period end, we continue to favor 30-year over 15-year GNMAs as a part of our overall strategy to earn incremental yield and to target specific prepayment characteristics. We have a bias toward higher-coupon 30-year GNMAs, which we believe could outperform if interest rates rise. We believe our out-of-benchmark position in reverse-mortgage securities also represents an opportunity to add incremental yield.We also continue to be cautious of GNMA pools with significant concentrations of Veterans Affairs (VA) borrowers that could be subject to high prepayment rates. \u25a0",
        "PerformanceReview": "U.S. taxable investment-grade bonds posted a slightly positive return for the fourth quarter of 2017, amid record low volatility and strong demand for new issues. The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index returned 0.39%, as coupon income more than offset the negative price impact of modestly higher interest rates. The passage of a federal tax-reform package contributed to higher yields during the period, though its overall impact on the bond market has been fairly modest thus far.Longer-term rates rose moderately during the period, while shorter-term rates advanced more, continuing their yearlong climb and resulting in an ongoing flattening of the yield curve. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised target interest rates by 0.25 percentage points in December, and recent Fed communications suggest a broad-based consensus exists for the continuation of gradual policy-rate normalization. The Fed is planning for three quarter-point hikes in 2018; at period end, the market expected roughly two hikes for the new year.In addition, in October the FOMC began the process of slowly paring back the $4.5 trillion-worth of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities on its balance sheet. This long process of balance-sheet normalization may contribute to an uptick in volatility and higher market yields over time.Most economists believe the U.S. economy remains healthy, driven by strong consumer sentiment, ample business investment and a steadily tightening labor market. The unemployment rate continues to hover near a 17-year low, and many market participants expect continued labor market strength in 2018.Within the Bloomberg Barclays index, yield-advantaged, credit-sensitive sectors led the way amid a supportive backdrop for risk assets. U.S. corporate bonds advanced broadly, returning 1.17% for the quarter, meaningfully outpacing Treasuries (+0.05%). Within corporates, bonds issued by utility companies slightly outperformed those from financial and industrial firms.Within securitized sectors of the market, commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) edged Treasury investments with a return of 0.35%, partly driven by limited supply of these securities. Mortgage-backed securities (MBS) also had a slightly positive showing, advancing 0.15%.Among non-core fixed-income segments, U.S. corporate high yield outperformed similar-duration Treasuries with a return of 0.47%, according to Bloomberg Barclays, although the return notably lagged the absolute and risk-adjusted return of the past several quarters. Investment-grade emerging-markets performed similarly, returning 0.63%. Elsewhere, U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) stood out with a return of 1.26%, outperforming nominal Treasuries. \u25a0",
