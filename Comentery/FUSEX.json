        "PerformanceReview": "For the quarter, the fund's share classes finished roughly in line with the 6.64% return of the benchmark S&P 500\u00ae index, which in December marked its ninth consecutive calendar quarter of gains. U.S. stocks reached an all-time high in December, supported by strong corporate profits across many industries.The U.S. economy expanded amid encouraging employment reports that in October led the U.S. Federal Reserve to begin paring economic stimulus.U.S. equity markets, meanwhile, rallied on the economic news, as well as approval of new tax legislation that may bolster earnings in several industries. At the same time, risks such as escalating tension with nuclear-armed North Korea and political wrangling at times dampened some of investors' enthusiasm.Outside the U.S., most developed countries experienced near-synchronized growth and market gains that partly were driven by a U.S. dollar that weakened relative to other foreign currencies.Growth-oriented stocks generally outperformed value stocks the past three months. Among the index's 11 sectors, consumer discretionary (+10%) performed best, anchored by the double-digit returns of online retailing giant Amazon.com and home improvement chain Home Depot.Information technology (+9%) also posted a solid return. Strong corporate earnings propelled this sector's result for much of the three months, despite a brief November sell-off as investors became increasingly concerned IT stocks were overvalued.As riskier segments of the market drew the most investor interest, defensive sectors such as utilities (0%) and health care (+1%) struggled and posted the weakest results.Regardless of the market environment, we apply a disciplined investment process across all of our strategies, relying on highly skilled professionals and robust investment infrastructure. Investment performance \u2013 absolute, relative and risk-adjusted \u2013 is the foundation of our investment value proposition for shareholders. This is true of our comprehensive suite of low-cost index funds. We expect our index funds to perform as closely to their benchmarks as possible. Over time, we seek to reduce tracking error, also known as the amount an index fund's performance deviates from its target index. Whether it's through solid trading techniques for funds that completely replicate an index or our use of statistical sampling and optimization techniques when necessary, we are focused on delivering returns in line with benchmark performance. \u25a0",
